### What is it?

The repository contains additional iOS Lectures materials such as code sources that were shown in lecture demos and quick tasks (home work) to improve your skills related to the lecture topic.

You can access additional materials directly using the repository. A link to additional lecture materials will be also provided in a related lecture video description on YouTube.

### Repository structure

The repository has the following sctructure:

```
.
├── README.md
├── <iOS RSSchool Course Year>
│   ├── <Lecture topic>
│   │   ├── Demos
│   │   │   ├── Demo <Demo number> – <Demo title>
│   │   │   │   ├── <Demo content>
│   │   ├── Tasks
│   │   │   ├── Task <Task number>
│   │   │   │   ├── <Task content>
```

### How should I use it?

After each lecture you should open materals for the lecture and do the following:

- **Play with demo projects**. Starter (Optionally) and Final project can be provided for each technical demo from the lecture. In case Starter project is provided, please, open the project and complete the code to the final state. In case Started project isn't provided, please, open the final project and play with it: investigate how it works, change some parts of the code and take a look what happens.
- **Solve provided tasks**. In case tasks are provided, please, solve each of them to improve your skills related to the topic, face and overcome challenges. Later during an assessment (technical interview) interviewer can ask you for any task solution to check and discuss it. So, please, don't skip tasks. The tasks solution will be neccessary in the future.
